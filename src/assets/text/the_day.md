Nervous to speak, nervous to breathe, nervous to look at you. That was a day full of emotions. Whenever I listen to our song Nervous, I relieve that day...

I wanted everything to be perfect. The location, the time, the weather, the atmosphere, my looks and even a perfect and beautiful calendar date - everything. I hope you liked every last bit like I did.

As you already know, I wanted to recreate my dream as I was confessing to you. If I only had recognized the lake of my dream that would've been so cool. But nevertheless, being in the moment with you was and yet it is still the most perfect thing to experience.

You have no idea what my heart had experienced. I felt the rhythm of my heartbeat pounding loud. It was a thrill of adventure. You took me to a place nobody even knows. You made me escape from reality and travel to a full new universe. A universe, where only the two of us exist...

Eventually I could say the words 'I love you'.

I love you honey. I am proud and honored to be allowed to love you. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to prove to you, that I will be the best person you've ever dreamed of. I will give and do everything I can to give you the best life and to make you the happiest. I want to be the luck in your life and I want to be the one who always makes you smile. I want to be your happiness. I want to be the person you have no regrets on. I want to be everything. I will give you the world.
