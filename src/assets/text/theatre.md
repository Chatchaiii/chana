God, was I nervous to see your theatre. Honestly, I was scared of what I could see there due to jealousy, but nevertheless I would admire you in every scene and watch everything of an infinite amount of times again. I was flashed by your beauty that day. The light that was shining on you on stage fit you so perfectly. I kept the reflection of you in my eyes the whole evening - I still do. I watched you like I was a proud husband, admiring the work of his wife even though we weren't even a couple officially. And yet it felt like it. I thank you for looking at me with your beautifully shining eyes during the performance. My heart melted.
