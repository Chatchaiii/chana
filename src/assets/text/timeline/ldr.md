Even though we're not it one, it felt a lot like a long-distance relationship. Divided by distance, connected by virtual screens. Whenever my connection got lost or slow I immediately had bad mood. Everything that made it hard for me to see your face and listen to your voice was deathly annoying.

I'm proud of what we've made of of it. We've experienced a lot during those 2 weeks. I loved falling asleep and waking up with you. It felt like you were with me the whole time. Sleep calls meant a lot for me. I wish we'd do that every night - until the day comes on that we don't need screens anymore.

Although we were far apart, we came even closer. We've had a lot of late nights, sharing fragments of our personalities, getting to know each other better and better.

I still won't forget that one night...
