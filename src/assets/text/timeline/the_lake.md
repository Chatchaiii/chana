One of my core memories of us would be this day. I could recall everything by any time you would ask me. The smell of the air, the smell of our coffees, the smell of you - everything.

The atmosphere to be at such a place with you was a fulfillment for me. If I could, I would relive that day over and over again. I love to go through the memories captured by us. The green accent we had on our skins due to the sun shining through the leaves above us was so stunning. Even that was captured by the lenses of your camera. We need more of those.
