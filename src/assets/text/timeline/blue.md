Do you know what it feels like to have to best girlfriend ever? Well I assume you only know how to feel to be the best girlfriend.

I am incredibly lucky of having you. Every day my life reminds me for who and what I am doing all this. I want to achieve everything for you. I want to achieve everything with you. No matter what. There is no turning back for me.

\
I cannot thank you enough for being in my life. You're the best what happened to me. Everything with you is so beautiful, everything comes so natural - it came out of the blue. As blue as your stars are - the stars that you gave me. The stars in your eyes that reflect off of your beautifully bright eyes.

\
You know what I think of whenever I come close to you admire your eyes? I am too close to the stars, I see myself in you, I see my reflection in your eyes.
