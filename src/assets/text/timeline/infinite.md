Paper, ink, words and emotions - captured in one. Everyone tells stories. Stories limited by their imaginations and real life. The words you use have so much power over me. As influencing as the books you love to read.

One of my favorite activities is to visit bookstores with you. Whenever we pass by, there is no way around it. The smell of paper, the smell of ink, the quiet atmosphere, the low light and you. I feel infinite.
