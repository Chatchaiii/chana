Reflections... As soon as I hear that word I think of three particular things. 1 - Your eyes. 2 - Mirror pictures of us. 3. The song that connects us and reminds me of us. As soon as the light fades, the reflections vanishes - A perfect example of you being the light in my life.

The reason why I want to give my best and 100% everywhere is simply you. One of my dreams is to see you one day in that one beautiful dress with flowers inside the palms of your hands. Putting rings on each others fingers and put out promises.

At the lake, when you held those flowers, I saw a fracture of that future that is waiting for us. I can't wait for it to come true.
