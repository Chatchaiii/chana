And again. What do we do after seeing each other for a long time? We eat sushi. You can't imagine the kind of feelings I had - not only when I could finally see you again but also eating sushi with you. Sharing our food and love for each other became one of my favorite and memorable experiences I could ever have with you. The atmosphere, the conversations, the eye-contact, the taste of the food, the taste of your lips - everything.
