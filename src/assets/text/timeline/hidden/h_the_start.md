Funny side-story. I wasn't even visually prepared on that day to meet you again. I was so nervous about my appearance. (I was not shaved, my face was full of hair and my car wasn't washed) I didn't have enough time after university to return back home and prepare myself. So i went to nearest Rossmann and bought shaving stuff and wet wipes... I shaved myself in the car and also cleaned the car with paper and Glasreiniger. You can judge me now for that... I also sprayed the whole car with my cologne...
