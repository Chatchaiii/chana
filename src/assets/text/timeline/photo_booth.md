I may acted like it was a normal day, but I was excited as fuck. I planned already to visit a Photo-booth with you. I was nervous about if you'd really like that idea. Turned out we took one of the most iconic photos together. I cannot stop looking at the photo stripe that stands on my computer at home. I was really incredibly happy when I found out that there was also a video taken. My heart melts at any moment I watch it. I get caught by you smile, by your eyes and by the beauty of yours. Time stand still but also passed by too fast that day. I couldn't help myself.

I'm lost, lost in feelings I have for you. They're too much and never ending. It's a swirl of chaos but simultaneously a harmony of perfect tones - a symphony.

Whenever our eyes lock, it's like my heart stops. You turned my world upside down. When you give me those eyes, it's the look of love I see. Speaking of the look of love...
