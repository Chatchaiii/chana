Again, I'm really sorry for pre-celebrate your birthday because of me. I wish I could be spending time with you in your real birthday. Next time we will do for sure. Maybe we will be abroad when celebrating next year.

Excitement was on it's peak. I've panicked a lot. I hoped I made the right presents. I was nervous and scared if you'd even like my surprises. I am glad you did. It was priceless to see your reactions and joy. I'd do everything for that smile and the glances of yours.
