Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night
What were the chances we'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

\
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

\
Every night we had tells a story by itself. We didn't have to do much to make it special. Being in the moment together was already the special thing that happened.

\
There hasn't been a single night where I didn't wish you to be with me. I'd love to have late night talks on late night walks. I want to joke around in the streets where no human wallks pass us. I want it to be quiet. So quiet that the only things you hear would be our heartbeats. I am sure they beat in sync whenever we laugh together.
