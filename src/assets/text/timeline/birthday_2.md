I was scared to miss your birthday. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey it was so late already. I had no connection, no internet or wifi. I hoped I would arrive by the time the clock hits midnight to congratulate you to your birthday but my luck had other plans. I reached the hotel at 4am. (2am in Germany) I was almost crying because I know you were worried about me due to no messaging. I was scared you couldn't sleep well or had some overthinking thoughts. Usually I wouldn't call you that late to wake you up. But I did it to assure myself you'd have an empty head without worries. I didn't want you to have some nightmares about me. So I called and also congratulated you. I was sad that this was all I could give you.

Luckily Parnia texted me in the morning. Teaching me about the different calendar schedule you have. I completely forgot about that. I knew you've once told me, but I couldn't recall.

That was my change to make it up for you. I tried to speak farsi for you and posted it on that channel. I took some notes from Parnia to learn how to pronounce everything. I hoped you really liked it, although my pronunciation was so bad.
