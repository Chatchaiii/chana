One of the hardest days I've ever experienced (not in a sexual context - at least this time) was to see you going away. It was nothing like when we have to say goodbye due to bringing you home. This time was different.

Knowing you're going to travel to a very far place, not easy to reach for me made it even harder to say goodbye. I am more than thankful, that I have a person in my life that makes saying goodbye the hardest for me. I couldn't help myself but counting the days already I had to spend without you. My heart was lonely.

I haven't told you that yet. But when you left my arms after saying goodbye for the last time, I felt empty. I could smell your scent but you weren't there. It was painful, my heart was burning like fire. Hollow, like there was nothing inside. I left tears as you passed the security control and faded in front of my eyes. I stayed there for a while and sat at the airport.

I am happy that we spent the time we still had together. Even though it was a beautiful experience, it was also a horrible experience to be that far away from you for days. (I know that my trip was worse, BUT STILL)
