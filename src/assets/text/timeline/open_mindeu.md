Excuse me. Do yuh libe aloneh? Are you open mindeu? Despite my weirdness and bad jokes I still have no idea how you still can stand me. That question will always haunt me forever I assume.

I can be myself with you, without worrying that you might judge me. The fact that you not only endure my weird moments but continue yourself makes me melt even more. Every single time when I thought I couldn't fall in love even more, you proved me wrong.
