The weather first had different plans for us. It was rainy, it was windy, it was cloudy - like a storm. A storm that reminds me of the chaos of feelings I have whenever I am with you.

I love how we hid in the car and started sharing our time together. It's so easy to enjoy every situation with you. Every situation becomes the best, as long as you're with me.

We've created our first pictures as a couple. I still hold onto them. I love how they came out. Our luck and happiness both captured by one frame.

Eventually the chaos and the storm settled. We went out for a walk and had one of the most stunning sunsets I've ever seen. The sun burnt it's color on your skin and made your eyes shine brighter. The eyes that I could never stop looking at.
